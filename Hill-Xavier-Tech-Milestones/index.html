            <h1>1950</h1>
            <p> In this time the ERA was introduced. 
            The ERA 1101 is one of the first commercially produced computers,
            the company's first customer was the US Navy. The ERA 1101 was invented 
            by Remington Rand. this invention was intended for high speed computing 
            and stored 1 million bits on a magnetic drum, one of the earliest magnetic
            storage devices which was good in a labatory. </p>
            <p> Next in this period wa the NPL Pilot Ace was completed.
                it was constucted at the National Physical Laboratory.Its 
                was based on the ideas of Alan Turning he said,'We are trying 
                to build a machine to do all kinds of different things simply
                 by programing rather than by addition of extra apparatus,'</p>
            <p> Then there where plans to build the Simon 1 relay logic machine 
              are published by Raido Electronics which the design was by Edmund Berkeley's
              in his book, Giant Brains, Berkeley note,'We shall now consider how we can design
              a very simple machine that will think. Let us call it Simon, because of it could
              be built to fill up less space than a grocery-storebox;about four cubic feet.' </p>
              <p>Finally in this time period the SEAC and SWAC was completed. The Seac is also
             known as the "Standards Eastern Automatic Computer" is the first stored program
             computer completed in the US well completed in Washington DC.Then the NBS also built
            the SWAC "Standards Western Automatic Computer" like the SEAC the SWAC was used with
            already developed technology. This invention was used to solve problems in numerical
            analysis,including developing climate models and discovering the five previous unkown
            Mersenne prime numbers.</p>

            <p>In the year 1951 the computers advance again which brought Ferranti Mark 1 sold.</p>
